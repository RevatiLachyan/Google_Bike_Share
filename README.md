# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

## Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

### Project Overview

This project analyzes Cyclistic’s bike-share data to understand the differences between casual riders and annual members. The goal is to derive insights that can help convert casual riders into annual members, thereby increasing the company’s profitability.

### Business Task

The primary objective is to answer the following question:

- How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

### Dataset

- The analysis is based on historical bike trip data from the past 12 months.
- Due to the large dataset size, a connection was created in Excel without loading all data into memory.
- Data transformations and visualizations were performed in Excel.

### Analysis Process

The project follows a structured data analysis approach:

1. **Ask**: Define the business problem and identify key stakeholders.
2. **Prepare**:
   - Download and store the Cyclistic trip data appropriately.
   - Identify data structure and format.
   - Assess data credibility and privacy considerations.
3. **Process**:
   - Data cleaning: Remove missing values, incorrect entries, and duplicates.
   - Create calculated fields such as `ride_length` and `day_of_week`.
   - Filter and transform data for relevant insights.
4. **Analyze**:
   - Perform descriptive analysis using Excel.
   - Use pivot tables to identify patterns and trends.
   - Compare key metrics between casual riders and members.
5. **Share**:
   - Create visualizations to highlight findings.
   - Present results in a structured PowerPoint presentation.
6. **Act**:
   - Develop actionable recommendations based on insights.
   - Suggest improvements to increase annual memberships.

### Key Findings

- **Ride Duration**: Casual riders tend to have longer ride durations than members.
- **Seasonality**: Bike usage is highest in warm months (June-September) and decreases in colder months.
- **Bike Type Preference**: Classic bikes are the most popular among both user groups.
- **Usage Patterns**:
  - Casual riders use bikes more on weekends, likely for leisure or tourism.
  - Annual members use bikes more on weekdays, likely for commuting.
  - On weekends, both user groups have similar bike usage patterns, whereas on weekdays, members use bikes significantly more.

### Recommendations

1. **Membership Incentives**:
   - Offer discounts for longer trips to members to encourage casual riders to subscribe.
2. **Seasonal Marketing Strategy**:
   - Advertise more during winter months to drive membership sign-ups before summer.
3. **Enhanced Features for Members**:
   - Introduce more comfortable seating and warm handle grips for members to make the membership more appealing.


### Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (for data connections and visualizations)

This project serves as a case study for understanding user behavior in bike-sharing systems and developing data-driven marketing strategies.
